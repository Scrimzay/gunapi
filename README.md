the worlds best gun api for gun ehthusiasts. its very simple, creates a sqlite3 db (db included in repo), adds info to the db, then makes db calls based on the endpoint visited. very simple and cool.

how to use:

1. visit one of the apis endpoints (i.e. localhost:4000/all or localhost:4000/name/Vector)

2. use the json response in your own api to make your own site (i will do this eventually and then link the repo here if i ever do as an example to what can be made)
